# linear_regression

In this code, the linear_regression function takes two vectors of numbers, x and y, and computes the intercept and slope of the linear regression model using the least squares method. The intercept and slope are returned as reference parameters. The main function shows an example of how to use the linear_regression function to fit a linear regression model to some sample data.
